## Getting Started

1. Complete setup tasks in `FOR YOU TO DO` file in project root
2. Run `task-master models --setup` to configure AI models
3. Review tasks with `task-master list`
4. Start with task 1: `task-master show 1`

## Using TaskMaster

Key commands:
- `task-master list` - View all tasks
- `task-master next` - Get next task to work on
- `task-master show <id>` - View task details
- `task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=done` - Mark task complete
- `task-master expand --id=<id>` - Break down complex tasks

## Task Dependencies

Tasks are organized with dependencies. Always complete prerequisite tasks before moving to dependent ones. Use `task-master next` to automatically find the next available task.

## Priority Levels

- **High**: Critical path items (backend, auth, AI)
- **Medium**: Important features (organization, export, analytics)
- **Low**: Nice-to-have polish (advanced animations, DOCX export)

## Notes

- Current focus: Backend infrastructure and authentication (Tasks 1-10)
- All tasks have detailed implementation guidance in `details` field
- Test strategies provided for quality assurance
- Refer to main PRD (`docs/prd.txt`) for comprehensive context
