Review all the .md files under the md_instructions folder.
If you've implemented something new that changes things, make sure to update the instructions found in the appropriate .md file.
After reading the md files declare in bold. I HAVE REVIEWED THE MD FILES
Any new documentation md files should be placed in the md_instructions folder
Any new tests should be placed in the appropriate place in the tests folder

if you create one off test scripts to verify something, make sure to delete the script afterwards. Only test scripts that belong to test suites for continuous integration should remain. 

familiarize yourself with the mcp servers you have access to and use them when needed.

If there's anything for me to do outside of the codebase, like setting up certain configurations within third party sites/services then write it down/ append it into a list file called FOR YOU TO DO
